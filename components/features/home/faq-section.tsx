    question: 'What is Doorman and how does it work?',
    answer:
      'Doorman is a secure, hosted page that lets your users grant you least-privileged access to their AWS accounts. You send your users a link, they approve access, and you get the credentials you needâ€”no manual setup or risky sharing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Doorman secure?',
    answer:
      "Yes! Security is our top priority. All access is least-privileged, temporary, and fully auditable. We never store your user's AWS credentials, and all actions are encrypted in transit and at rest.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a connection?',
    answer:
      'A connection is a unique AWS account that your users have granted you access to via Doorman. Each time a user connects their AWS account, it counts as one connection toward your plan limit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get started?',
    answer:
      'Just sign up, create your branded access page, and share the link with your users. You can start for free and upgrade as you grow.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use my own branding?',
    answer:
      'Yes! Paid plans let you fully customize your access page with your logo, colors, and company details.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What support do you offer?',
    answer:
      'We offer email support for all plans, and priority support for paid tiers. Enterprise customers get a dedicated support manager.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I cancel or change my plan anytime?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time from your dashboard.',
